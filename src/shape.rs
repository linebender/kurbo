//! A generic trait for shapes.

use crate::{segments, BezPath, Circle, Line, PathEl, Point, Rect, RoundedRect, Segments};

/// A generic trait for open and closed shapes.
///
/// This trait provides conversion from shapes to [`BezPath`]s, as well as
/// general geometry functionality like computing [`area`], [`bounding_box`]es,
/// and [`winding`] number.
///
/// [`area`]: Shape::area
/// [`bounding_box`]: Shape::bounding_box
/// [`winding`]: Shape::winding
pub trait Shape: Sized {
    /// The iterator returned by the [`path_elements`] method.
    ///
    /// [`path_elements`]: Shape::path_elements
    type PathElementsIter: Iterator<Item = PathEl>;

    /// Returns an iterator over this shape expressed as [`PathEl`]s;
    /// that is, as Bézier path _elements_.
    ///
    /// All shapes can be represented as Béziers, but in many situations
    /// (such as when interfacing with a platform drawing API) there are more
    /// efficient native types for specific concrete shapes. In this case,
    /// the user should exhaust the `as_` methods ([`as_rect`], [`as_line`], etc)
    /// before converting to a [`BezPath`], as those are likely to be more
    /// efficient.
    ///
    /// In many cases, shapes are able to iterate their elements without
    /// allocating; however creating a [`BezPath`] object always allocates.
    /// If you need an owned [`BezPath`] you can use [`to_path`] instead.
    ///
    /// # Tolerance
    ///
    /// The `tolerance` parameter controls the accuracy of
    /// conversion of geometric primitives to Bézier curves, as
    /// curves such as circles cannot be represented exactly but
    /// only approximated. For drawing as in UI elements, a value
    /// of 0.1 is appropriate, as it is unlikely to be visible to
    /// the eye. For scientific applications, a smaller value
    /// might be appropriate. Note that in general the number of
    /// cubic Bézier segments scales as `tolerance ^ (-1/6)`.
    ///
    /// TODO: When [GAT's] land, the type of this can be changed to
    /// contain a `&'a self` reference, which would let us take
    /// iterators from complex shapes without cloning.
