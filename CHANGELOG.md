# Changelog

The latest published Kurbo release is [0.11.3](#0113-2025-07-21) which was released on 2025-07-21.
You can find its changes [documented below](#0113-2025-07-21).

## [Unreleased]

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.82.
It was increased to support floating point math in const functions.

### Changed

- The implementation of stroking is much faster. ([#427][] by [@raphlinus][])
- More `Vec2` methods can now be called in `const` contexts. ([#479][] by [@tomcur][])
- `aspect_ratio` on `Rect` and `Size` has been deprecated and replaced with `aspect_ratio_width`.
  This is because the implementation of `aspect_ratio` used the ratio of height to width, whereas
  aspect rations are otherwise always ratios of width to height. ([#486][] by [@ErisianArchitect][] and [@DJMcNab][])
- Deprecated `contained_rect_with_aspect_ratio`, replaced with `inscribed_rect_with_aspect_ratio`, which
  incidentally also uses the usual definition of aspect ratio (where the old name didn't). ([#486][] by [@DJMcNab][])

### Fixed

- Fix miter join in dashed strokes. ([#490][] by [@gemberg][])

### Removed

- Breaking change: `DashIterator` has been removed. Replace `DashIterator::new` with `dash`. ([#488][] by [@DJMcNab][])
- Breaking change: The previously deprecated `BezPath::flatten`, `Ellipse::[with_]x_rotation`, `{Rect, Size}::is_empty`, `Shape::[in]to_bez_path`,
  and `TranslateScale::as_tuple` have been removed.([#487][] by [@DJMcNab][])

### Removed

- Breaking change: The `offset` module amd the deprecated `CubicOffset` have been removed. ([#489][] by [@DJMcNab][])

## [0.11.3][] (2025-07-21)

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.65.

### Added

- Add `current_position` method to `BezPath`. ([#462][] by [@sagudev][])
- Add `From` conversions between `euclid` and `kurbo` types behind the `euclid` feature. ([#463][] by [@sagudev][])
- Add Green's theorem moments. ([#452][] by [@simoncozens][])
- Make `Vec2::splat` public. ([#469][] by [@xorgy][])

### Changed

- Let more methods take `Into<Point>` instead of `Point`. ([#466][] by [@sagudev][])

  **Note**: this can impact type inference.
- Inline the `Mul<PathEl>` implementation for `Affine`. ([#461][] by [@LaurenzV][])
- Inline the `next` method of the `ToQuads` iterator. ([#460][] by [@LaurenzV][])
- Avoid calling `f64::hypot`, as it calls a slow library function. ([#448][] by [@beholdnec][], [#451][] by [@raphlinus][])

### Fixed

- Documentation of `RoundedRect` no longer incorrectly specifies the corner radii are equal. ([#447][] by [@tomcur][])
- Fixed negative dash offset by normalization. ([#454][] by [@sagudev][])
- Use exact endpoints for `PathSeg`. ([#465][] by [@jneem])

## [0.11.2][] (2025-04-28)

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.65.

### Added

- `Stroke` is now `PartialEq`, `StrokeOpts` is now `Clone`, `Copy`, `Debug`, `Eq`, `PartialEq`. ([#379][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
- Implement `Sum` for `Vec2`. ([#399][] by [@Philipp-M][])
- Add triangle shape. ([#350][] by [@juliapaci][], [#387][] by [@tomcur][])
- Implement `Div<f64>` and `Mul<f64>` for `Insets`. ([#384][] by [@liferooter][])
- Add `Vec2::turn_90` and `Vec2::rotate_scale` methods ([#409][] by [@raphlinus][])
- Add `min` and `max` methods to `Size`. ([#412][] by [@nils-mathieu][])
- Add an `INFNITY` constant to `Size`. ([#413][] by [@nils-mathieu][])
- Add `BezPath::with_capacity` method ([#418][] by [@LaurenzV][])
- Add  `Affine::scale_about` and `Affine::then_scale_about`. ([#429][] by [@xorgy][])

### Changed

- Reduce number of operations in `Triangle::circumscribed_circle`. ([#390][] by [@tomcur][])
- Numerically approximate ellipse perimeter. ([#383][], [#407][] by [@tomcur][])
- Always inline trivial casts, splats, and swizzles. ([#428][] by [@xorgy][])

### Fixed

- Fix documentation of `Affine::svd`. ([#388][] by [@tomcur][])
- Fix documentation of cross product. ([#409][] by [@raphlinus][])

## [0.11.1][] (2024-09-12)

- Add `CubicBez::tangents` ([#288][] by [@raphlinus][])
- Add `Arc::reversed`. ([#367][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
- Add `CircleSegment::inner_arc` and `CircleSegment::outer_arc` ([#368][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
- Add `Rect::is_zero_area` and `Size::is_zero_area` and deprecate their `is_empty` methods. ([#370][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
- Add `Line::reversed` and `Line::midpoint`. ([#375][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
- Allow construction of `Line` from `(Point, Point)` and `(Point, Vec2)`. ([#376][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

### Changed

- Move `Self: Sized` bound from `Shape` to methods. ([#340][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
- Enable partial SVG path support in `no_std` builds. ([#356][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])
- Deprecate `BezPath::flatten`, prefer `flatten`. ([#361][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])

### Fixed
